### Project Summary

**Title: Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Performance**

This project involves using Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the future performance of a stock portfolio, calculating potential returns, and analyzing the worst drawdown. The analysis includes downloading historical stock data, simulating future returns, visualizing simulation results, and identifying the worst drawdown in portfolio value.

### Key Features:
- **Historical Data Retrieval:** Downloaded historical stock prices for specified tickers using Yahoo Finance API.
- **Performance Calculation:** Calculated daily performance and covariance matrix of stock returns.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Performed simulations to forecast portfolio performance over a specified number of days, considering user-defined weights and investment amount.
- **Visualization:** Plotted simulation results, including median simulation line and 95% confidence interval. Visualized the portfolio's price and drawdown with annotations.
- **Drawdown Analysis:** Calculated and identified the worst drawdown period, including maximum loss percentage and duration of the drawdown.

### Key Skills:
- **Programming:** Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, yfinance)
- **Financial Analysis:** Portfolio performance simulation, covariance matrix calculation
- **Data Visualization:** Plotting simulation results, drawdown analysis
- **Statistical Analysis:** Monte Carlo simulations, summary statistics calculation
